                 GNU Go Installation Instructions

Get the most recent tar file from ftp.gnu.org or a mirror (see
http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html for a list).

Untar the sources, change to the directory gnugo-2.5.xx. Now do:

   ./configure
   make

This makes a binary called interface/gnugo. Now (running as root) type

   make install

to install gnugo in /usr/local/bin. This will also install the man
page gnugo.6 into /usr/man/man6.

There are two methods of using GNU Go. You may run it from the
command line by just typing:

   gnugo

but it is nicer to run it under X-Windows using CGoban.

Obtain the most recent version of CGoban from Bill Shubert's web site:
http://www.inetarena.com/~wms/comp/cgoban. The CGoban version number
MUST be 1.9.1 at least or it won't work.

See the README file for instructions on how to run GNU Go from Cgoban.


                          PROBLEMS

On one GNU/Linux machine compilation failed because it had an
incompatible /usr/include/curses.h (from BSD) which had declarations
inconsistent with those in /usr/include/term.h. The symptom of this
problem is compilation errors in src/moyo.c and src/showbord.c.

In this case, the correct curses.h was found in /usr/include/ncurses
and a correct compilation was obtained after changing

     #include <curses.h>

to

     #include <ncurses/curses.h>

in src/moyo.c and src/showbord.c. If you have a problem with errors in
src/moyo.c and src/showbord.c caused by curses you should try such a
remedy first. If this doesn't work, you shouldn't curse. Run
'configure --disable-color' to turn off the color option and compile
again. Another alternative if you want color is 'configure
--without-curses --enable-color'.


                        THE MANUAL

You can obtain a printed copy of the manual by running
'make gnugo.dvi' in the doc/ directory, then printing the
resulting .dvi file. The manual contains a great deal of
information about the algorithms of GNU Go.
