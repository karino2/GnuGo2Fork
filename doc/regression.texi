the @option{--mode test} option of gnugo allows for testing of moves.

generated moves are tested against annotations and actual moves

@example

/* ANNOTATION PROPERTIES:
* Circle:   Good Move
* Triangle: OK move
* Square:   Bad move   (Mark too... cgoban writes MA instead of SQ)
* Move that was made:  considered good unless annotated (BM, TE)
*/
@end example


@section Example

The regression directory contains an example @file{test-tree.sgf} which shows
how the testing works.  Look at it with your favorite editor, then run it
through the test to see how it performs.

A sample test run:

@example
gnugo --mode test --testmode annotation --infile test-tree.sgf --quiet
@end example
